Hello! I'm Mark Bedaywi, a first year Computer Science PhD student at [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) in [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), working on AI safety and EconML, supervised by [Nika Haghtalab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nika/) and [Stuart Russell](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/).

I've done work on fairly aggregating preferences in multi-agent systems, accelerating reinforcement learning algorithms, and identifying safety failure modes for AI assistants. My current interests include collaborative learning in the presence of incentives, inverse reinforcement learning & assistance games, and the game theory of persuasion, agreement & cooperation.
