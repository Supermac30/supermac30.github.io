Hi! I'm Mark Bedaywi, a fourth year undergraduate studying computer science and mathematics at the University of Toronto. I'm interested very broadly in creating systems with privacy, robustness, fairness, and safety guarantees. The end goal being to ensure that learning algorithms are as trustworthy as they can be.
